Following the tech stack given in 'context/tech_stack.md', please write the Astro code that would give the same result as 'pages/page1.pdf', considering that this design is what we want for our home page.

Please follow those instructions:

Ignore the photo that takes the full width of the page at the top, we'll add it later.

Those should be clickable and link somewhere (they'll all link to the home page in this first draft):
- the logo on the top left corner ("Verre et Papilles")
- the social media handles on the top right corner ("instagram" and "facebook") and "nous contacter"
- the three orange circles ("les Bocaux du Jour", "Le Crottin Craonnais", "Les Coffrets Gourmands")

The three logos of partners: "Valrhona", "Alain Milliat" and "Terre Exotique" should be organized in a carousel

The last words at the bottom: "Les Bocaux" should be replaced by "à propos" and "nous contacter", which should also be links (to homepage at this stage)

Please also provide a walkthrough to see this code in the browser of my local machine (I have nom and node installed, and I use chromium).
